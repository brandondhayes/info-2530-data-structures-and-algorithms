You should already have a class called Numbers from the first exercise.  Add the following methods to it.

    An instance method called randomize() that creates and assigns random number in the range 0 to 100 to the elements of the encapsulated array (hint, look up the java.util.Random class).
    Create methods called bubbleSort(), selectionSort(), and insertionSort().  They should perform the appropriate kind of sort on the data in your array.


In your NumbersDriver class, do the following:

    Create a Numbers object with 10 elements.
    Call the randomize method.
    Display the contents of the array.
    Call the bubbleSort method.
    Display the contents of the array.
    Call the randomize method.
    Display the contents of the array.
    Call the selectionSort method.
    Display the contents of the array.
    Call the randomize method.
    Display the contents of the array.
    Call the insertionSort method.
    Display the contents of the array.
