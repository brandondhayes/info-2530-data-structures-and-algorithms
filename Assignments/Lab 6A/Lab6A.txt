Code a recursive function that does the following.  

Every run of the function, it will generate a random number from 1 to 20 and display the random number.  When it finally generates a 20, the function stops and it will print the total of all the random numbers that were generated.

Run the recursive function in your main method.

The output might look like this:

Run 1, random number 7
Run 2, random number 19
Run 3, random number 1
Run 4, random number 20
Run ended.  The total of the random numbers is 47.

WARNING:  I often get solutions to recursive exercises that do not use recursion.  If you submit one of those, it's an automatic zero.  Understand what recursion is before you submit your exercise.
