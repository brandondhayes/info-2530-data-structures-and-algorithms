 The AssemblyLine class has a potential problem.  Since the only way you can remove an object from the AssemblyLine array is when the insert method returns an object from the last element of the AssemblyLine's encapsulated array, what about those ManufacturedProduct  objects that are "left hanging" in the array because they never got to the last element position?  How do we get them out?

Lab 4B is to modify your project so you can deal with the above problem and return those objects.
